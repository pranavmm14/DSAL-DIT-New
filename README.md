# Data Structures and Algorithms Lab Codes

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Data Structures and Algorithms lab codes! My name is Pranav Mehendale, and I am a computer engineering student at Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Technology, Pimpri, which is affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University.

The codes in this repository are based on the SPPU syllabus of 2019 pattern and cover most of the practicals taught in our college.

## Purpose of this Repository

I created this repository to serve as a valuable resource and reference for anyone studying Data Structures and Algorithms. Whether you're a student like me or a professional looking to refresh your knowledge, these codes will provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.
